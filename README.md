# OneStopServ
The oneStepServe project is a web-based application designed to streamline and simplify client and company interactions through an intuitive navigation system. 

#Overview:
oneStepServe is a platform built to facilitate seamless communication and service management between clients and companies. The project involves implementing dynamic navigation links and buttons based on the user's login status. This ensures that users (either clients or companies) see only the options that are relevant to their roles.

# Key Features:
--> Role-Based Navigation:
Users (clients or companies) can log in to the platform.
Based on the user's role and login status, the system dynamically displays relevant navigation links and buttons, offering personalized experiences for each user type.

--> User Authentication:
The application incorporates user authentication mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain sections of the platform.
The UserStorageService handles authentication tokens and user IDs, making the system secure and managing user sessions efficiently.

--> Client and Company Interaction:
Clients can access services, submit requests, and view information related to the services provided by the company.
Companies can manage client interactions, respond to requests, and provide services through an organized dashboard, allowing for effective communication.

--> Responsive Design:
The system is built to be responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly across different devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

# Technology Stack:

--> Frontend: Angular
The frontend is developed using Angular to implement dynamic and interactive features. The navigation links and buttons are created using Angular components and directives.

--> Backend: Spring Boot
The backend is developed using Spring Boot, which handles the authentication and business logic for managing different roles (clients and companies).

--> Database: MySQL
Stores user data, login details, and records of interactions between clients and companies.

# Purpose:
The main objective of oneStepServe is to provide a unified platform where businesses and their clients can interact efficiently, with personalized navigation and secure access controls. It eliminates the need for multiple touchpoints by offering a single platform for all interactions, thereby increasing productivity and service quality.

This project is scalable and can be extended to accommodate additional features like analytics, notifications, and role-based access control, making it a versatile solution for businesses looking to enhance their client management processes.
